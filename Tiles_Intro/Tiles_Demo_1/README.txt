Added Background(Tile) Class
    - Parent Class = Tile()
    - Can now move individual tiles to create the illusion of a moving background.

Added module for a Tile-Color Randomizer
    - Tiles change color dependent on random number generation, import random 
    - Tiles are uniquely identified by position
      or by assigning some variable for id.
    - Conditions are set to ensure the outer edge of tiles is not included to 
      prove selective manipulation.
